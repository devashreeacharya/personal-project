It was a last minute plan, which is  a big deal for someone who doesn't get permissions easily. Weird i'd say, when you meet someone for the first time, and everything just goes blank. You can't move, you can't speak, everything else around just goes blur. I might forget everything when I'm old, but I'll never forget that day, and how that first eye contact made me feel. Someone so happy to see you for the very first time, is a rare incident!  </p>

It was basically a dispute about what you and shivangi spoke about, you realised i felt bad, and the first thing next day, you come to me, and we sort it out. It was the very first time we had something of that sort, it happened on the 3rd of August 2017, and I don't know about you, but I did feel good, that awwwww look at us, we'll overcome every obstacle life throws at us.

  	  <p> I guess this was the first and only date where i had dressed up, it was good, we didn't fight before we went, you didn't have to spend two hours trying to convince me to go out, the guys got us a cake, we went to tea villa, which was totally new for me, I still remember, love and cherish the Mac n Cheese Pizza we had. We've had it twice, and I still remember and adore 2017 for that. </p>

I will never forget how I felt, dressing up in these orange kurtas all of us, putting our phone in plastic covers so they don't get wet. Everybody on two wheelers, and a gang with everyone being a darling. It made me feel alive, that yesss, I want to do everything there is. I felt like saying yes to everything there was.  You were so happy everytime we had to go somewhere. I was taken care of a baby by you, which is exactly what made everything this special. Being treated by you, like there's one person who's rooting for just you. It was so much fun! All the dance, all the music, everything! </p>

Complete your pooja at home, then a wonderful boy comes home to pick you up everyday, and everyday he looks at you as if you're the most beautiful person he's seen, as if he's seeing you for the very first time, all over again. The feeling of dressing up and standing in front of someone who would appreciate the life out of you, was unique and wonderful! </p>

          <p class="p_modal">This play was just a blessing in disguise for me bro, it brought so much! So many memories so many experiences. I saw ahmedabad the way I had never done before. We technically went on our first "vacation" here. We've never actually gone out like this, in a new city ( at least for me ), exploring things, things that you force me to do, and then i end up loving them for life (Shakti Sandwich!!!!). Thank you Pratham, for pushing me, and giving me some of the best memories of life.<br>
